/*  
Welcome, new coder.

*/

console.log('Welcome to LaunchCode great workplace');
// console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"');

// console.log("Hello, World " + "and welcome!");
// console.log("Hello, World");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   Ans:- Did console.log("Hello, World");

   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   Ans:- No

   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   Ans:- We can use either but both qutes have to be same i.e.  both "" or ''.
   
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   Ans:- It will work.

   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   Ans:- console.log(5); and console.log(5+6);

   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   Ans:- console.log("Hello, World");
         console.log(5+6);

   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   Ans:- console.log("Hello, World " + "and welcome!");   


   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   Ans:- console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"');

   9. Other. You choose!
